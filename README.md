# ticTacToe
Tic tac toe game!


What i am happy with:

-Got the code away from the global scope.
-Understand the use of scope, closures and modules.
-Letting each function do one thing.

What would i do differently next time?:

-Plan it out with even more detail. In writing.
-Make an 1D array and display win-conditions as a list with combinations.
