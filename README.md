Tic tac toe game!<br /><br />


What i am happy with:<br /><br />

-Got the code away from the global scope.<br />
-Understand the use of scope, closures and modules.<br />
-Letting each function do one thing.<br />

What would i do differently next time?:<br /><br />

-Plan it out with even more detail. In writing.<br />
-Make an 1D array and display win-conditions as a list with combinations.<br />
-Make the board in javascript.<br />
